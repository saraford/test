Installation
------------


```{r eval=FALSE}
require(devtools)
install_github("rfigshare", "ropensci")
```

Getting Started
---------------



# Using rfigshare


```{r}
require(rfigshare)
```


```{r include = FALSE}
# This loads the rOpenSci figshare sandbox credentials, so that the example 
# can run automatically during check and install.  Unlike normal figshare accounts,
# data loaded to this testing sandbox is periodically purged.  
fs_auth(token = "xdBjcKOiunwjiovwkfTF2QjGhROeLMw0y0nSCSgvg3YQxdBjcKOiunwjiovwkfTF2Q", token_secret = "4mdM3pfekNGO16X4hsvZdg")
```

The first time you use an `rfigshare` function, it will ask you to authenticate online. Just log in and click okay to authenticate rfigshare.  R will allow you to cache your login credentials so that you won't be asked to authenticate again (even between R sessions), as long as you are using the same working directory in future.  

Try a search for an author:


```{r}
fs_author_search("Boettiger")
```



Try creating your own content:


```{r}
id <- fs_create("Test title", "description of test")
```


This creates an article with the essential metadata information. We can now upload the dataset to this newly created figshare object using `fs_upload`.  For the purposes of this example, we'll just upload one of R's built-in datasets:


```{r}
data(mtcars)
write.csv(mtcars, "mtcars.csv")
fs_upload(id, "mtcars.csv")
```


Not that we must pass the id number of our the newly created figshare object as the first argument.  Similar functions let us add additional authors, tags, categories, and links, e.g.


```{r}
fs_add_tags(id, "demo")
```



Minimal metadata includes title, description, type, and at least one tag and one category.  We can add categories using either the category id or the name of the category, but it must be one of the preset categories available.  We can ask the API for a list of all the categories:


```{r}
fs_category_list()
```


And we can add the category or categories we like,


```{r}
fs_add_categories(id, c("Education", "Software Engineering"))
```



The file we have created remains saved as a draft until we publish it, either publicly or privately.  Note that once a file is declared public, it cannot be made private or deleted.  Let's release this dataset privately:


```{r}
fs_make_private(id)
```


We can now share the dataset with collaborators by way of the private url.  

### The quick and easy way

The `rfigshare` package will let you create a new figshare article with additional authors, tags, categories, etc in a single command usnig the `fs_new_article` function.  The essential metadata `title`, `description` and `type` are required, but any other information we omit at this stage can be added later.  If we set `visibility` to private or public, the article is published on figshare immediately.  


```{r}
data(mtcars)
write.csv(mtcars,"mtcars.csv")
id <- fs_new_article(title="A Test of rfigshare", 
                     description="This is a test", 
                     type="dataset", 
                     authors=c("Karthik Ram", "Scott Chamberlain"), 
                     tags=c("ecology", "openscience"), 
                     categories="Ecology", 
                     links="http://ropensci.org", 
                     files="mtcars.csv",
                     visibility="private")
unlink("mtcars.csv") # clean up
```


# Examining Data on Figshare

We can view all available metadata of a figshare object. 


```{r}
fs_details(id)
```

You can see all of the files you have (Currently only up to 10):


```{r}
mine <- fs_browse()
mine[1:2]
```

Note that we can easily grab the ids with the wrapper function `fs_ids`:



```{r}
fs_ids(mine)
```

```
 [1] 105136 105135  97653  97500  97279  97218  96919  96916  95839    138
```




We can delete unwanted files that are not public with `fs_delete`:  


```{r}
fs_delete(id)
```

To cite package `rfigshare` in publications use:


```{r}
citation("rfigshare")
```
